### Project Overview
This project examines global CO₂ emissions trends from **1960 to 2022** to identify key contributors, and propose data-driven solutions to support a **15% reduction** target **by 2030**. The analysis was conducted using **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI**, leveraging the Six Sigma **DMAIC methodology** to ensure a structured and effective approach.
### DMAIC Approach
1) Define: Identified key sources of fossil fuel-based CO₂ emissions (industries, transportation, food production).
2) Measure: Collected and cleaned data from OurWorldInData, ensuring accuracy in global emissions reporting.
3) Analyze: Discovered a **311% increase in CO₂ emissions** (1960-2022) and identified top contributors **(U.S., China, India, Russia**).
4) Improve: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize emissions trends and propose actionable insights.
5) Control: Recommended clean energy initiatives (electric vehicles, renewable energy adoption) to help governments and organizations track progress toward reduction goals.

### Key Findings
- CO₂ emissions have **increased by 311%** since 1960. Top 4 contributors (U.S., China, India, Russia) account for a significant share of global emissions.
- **High-income nations** are **plateauing**, while **upper-middle-income** nations’ emissions are **rising**
- Technology and policy measures impact emissions more than income levels alone
- Deficiencies in energy reporting affect accuracy—better tracking mechanisms needed

### Conclusion
This project highlights the urgent need for **data-driven strategies** to combat rising CO₂ emissions, **which increased 311% since 1960 worldwide**), and mitigate climate change. By leveraging the **Six Sigma DMAIC framework**, we analyzed global emissions data, identified top contributors, and proposed **practical solutions** for reducing emissions by **15% by 2030**.

## Waiting Line Analysis - Froth Coffee Bar - [Project Link](https://github.com/SimpleStepper/College-Presentations/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/Waiting%20Line%20Analysis%20(Froth%20Coffee%20Bar).pdf)
### Project Overview
To optimize customer wait times and service efficiency at Froth Coffee Bar using **data analytics**, queueing theory, and **simulation modeling**. This analysis utilizes **descriptive statistics**, **probability distributions**, and **Monte Carlo simulations** to identify bottlenecks, evaluate service capacity, and recommend data-driven solutions using **Excel**.
### Simulations & Insights:
#### Simulation 1 (2 Servers – Current Setup)
- Modeled **1,000 customers** using **Monte Carlo simulations**
- Results:
  - Average wait time: **4.19 min**
  - Total time in system: **8.9 min**
  - **5% of customers wait over 20 minutes**
  - Only **60% of customers** experience a wait time within the acceptable 2-minute threshold

 #### Simulation 2 (3 Servers – Optimized Model)
- Increased staffing to **3 servers**, reran simulation with **1,000 customers**
- Key Results:
  - **Wait time reduced by 91% (38 sec avg.)**
  - **Service time decreased by 38%** (5.5 min avg.)
  - **Maximum wait time reduced by 61.5% (from 40 min to 15.4 min)**
  - **83%** fewer customers waiting over 20 minutes
  - **65%** of orders completed in under 6 minutes
 Results indicate that adding a third server significantly improves efficiency, reduces peak-hour congestion, and enhances customer experience.

### Final Recomendations
1. Add a Third Server:
   - The cost of **hiring another server ($10/hr)** is justified by the increased throughput and customer retention.
   - Reducing bottlenecks improves sales potential during peak hours.
2. Implement a Self-Service Kiosk:
   - A tablet-based ordering system **($800 one-time cost, 2.6% per transaction fee)** can reduce wait times by shifting order placement to customers.
   - Allows servers to focus on faster order fulfillment.
3. Optimize Staffing During Off-Peak Hours:
   - Analysis suggests reducing staff after **2 PM** when demand decreases, cutting labor costs while maintaining efficiency.
### Conclusion
By applying **Monte Carlo simulations** and **data analytics**, this study provides data-driven recommendations that **optimize customer wait times**, **improve service efficiency**, and **enhance overall business performance**. Implementing a third server, self-service kiosks, and online ordering can significantly reduce congestion and increase revenue potential at Froth Coffee Bar.

## Optimizing Supply Chain Efficiency: Amazon’s Strategic Innovations - [Project Link](https://github.com/SimpleStepper/College-Presentations/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/Amazon%20Presentation%20-%20OPSM%204820.pdf)
### Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon’s innovative strategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions, particularly during the 2022 holiday season. By leveraging vertical integration and data-driven logistics optimization, Amazon significantly reduced shipping delays compared to competitors.
### Key Insights & Solutions:
- In-House Cargo Containers: Amazon manufactured **10,000 cargo** containers to streamline domestic distribution and eliminate dependencies on external shipping cycles.
- Project Dragonboat: Amazon **chartered its own ships** to bypass congested ports and use smaller, more efficient docking locations.
- Prime Air Expansion: With **85 aircraft** and **164 daily flights**, Amazon enhanced its ability to quickly move high-demand goods.
### Impact:
- Reduced port delays from **45 days** to **2 days**
- Increased in-house package handling from **47% (2019) to 72% (2022)**
- Lowered reliance on third-party logistics providers
